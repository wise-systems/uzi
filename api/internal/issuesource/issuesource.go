// Package issuesource is the seam the services that read or write a repo's issues
// use to reach a linked external issue tracker (PRD #4173 DL-5). A service keeps
// its forge factory for the code-host side and for a repo whose link is NULL; for a
// linked repo it asks Sources, and a service with no Sources wired fails closed
// instead of falling back to the forge.
