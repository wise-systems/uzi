// SyncBoardFreeMRStates is the board-FREE MR-state recorder for every issue-less
// MR-bearing run — the prompt/self_improve lanes plus issue-less helper runs (mr_rework,
// ci_fix, and issue-less chat/task) — PRD #908, widened in issue #1253. The poller calls it
// once per repo per tick, right after SyncMRStates. Unlike SyncMRStates it moves NO board
// card: these runs are issue-less (no card) or share a non-board-promoted tracking issue. It
// only records runs.mr_state (via the existing recordMRState, the sole SQL writer — invariant
// preserved) and, on the opened->closed / ->merged edge, cancels an in-flight rework via the
// existing cancelReworkOnClosedMR (issue #853 contract, reused verbatim). Reads the run set
// from ListBoardFreeMRStateWatchCandidates, which self-evicts a run once its mr_state is
// terminal.
//
// SCOPE BOUNDARY (PRD #908 design, "self-bounding like Lane B"): for issue-less and
// scheduled-lane runs closed AND merged are terminal — the candidate query drops such a run at
// mr_state='closed', so a closed-then-reopened board-free MR is not re-watched. The exception
// is a repo linked to an external issue tracker (PRD #4173 M4): its issue-lane runs also stay
// candidates at mr_state='closed' (latest run of the issue only), so the reopen is recorded
// back to 'opened' by the default arm below and mr_rework regains eligibility. A closed MR
// that is still closed is a no-transition and fires no side effect.
//
// Like SyncMRStates it never returns a per-candidate error (log-and-skip); only a failure
// to enumerate candidates surfaces to the poller.
