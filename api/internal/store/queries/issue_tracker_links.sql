-- Repo to issue tracker project links (PRD #4173 M4, DL-3..DL-5).

-- name: GetRepoIssueSourceForUser :one
-- The one owner-scoped row the per-repo resolvers read (DL-5): the repo, its forge
-- connection and its issue tracker link. The binding is keyed by repo row id and the
-- owning user, never by forge project number. linked_connection_id is the link's
-- connection ONLY when it belongs to the same user as the forge connection; a linked
-- repo whose connection is missing for that owner reads NULL here and the resolver
-- fails closed.
